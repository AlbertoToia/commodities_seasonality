# SEASONALITY
### WHAT IS SEASONALITY 

Seasonality in financial markets refers to the tendency of asset prices to follow recurring patterns or cycles that occur during specific times of the year. 
These patterns can be influenced by a variety of factors, including seasonal events, economic cycles, and investor behavior.

Seasonality in financial markets goes beyond mere price fluctuations. It extends its reach into the aspects of macroeconomics, economic cycles, and multifaceted trends. 

Commodities like agricultural products and energy resources often display pronounced seasonal patterns due to factors like weather and demand fluctuations. Certain stock market indices, particularly those tied to specific sectors,  may also exhibit notable seasonality.

Major currency pairs, blue-chip stocks, and government bonds generally experience lower levels of seasonality. These assets are often influenced more by broader economic trends and geopolitical factors rather than seasonal fluctuations.
